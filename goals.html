  <h1>My goals in life!</h1>
<p class="lead">
My future plans are never straightfoward, there is too much I want to do. For now, and considering this course, it is to create a basic understanding for programming for the web. Eventually I am suppose to end up in project management/interaction design, and so I need to acquire basic skills for prototyping and such.

		<h2>Webbdesign</h2>
		I see this course as a stepping stone towards the greater goals. By gaining knowledge I can do prototypes and when I get to project management I will have a better understanding for the process the team/project group will need to perform.

		My primary focus is on acquiring skills and knowledge to work in interaction design. I find it very interesting, especially the social part with working with other people.
